# FastAI course by Jeremy Howard V.5

## Lesson 1 (Getting Started)
* Built an Image Classifier
  - Initially was a bird classifier
  - Alterred it to an apple classifier

## Lesson 2 (Deployment)
* Got acquainted with Huggingface spaces
  - Used it to deploy minimal model with user interface
  - Used it to run cat/dog classifier by uploading images of either
 
## Lesson 3 (Neural Net Foundation)
* Learned how gradient descent works practically
  - Built an excel-based regression model using tedious methods, then matrix multiplication
* Learned about the various (500+) neural net architectures
* Learned to prioritise quick iteration over data accumulation
* Learned importance of hyper parameters in choosing parameters for model
* Used paperspace notebooks
  - An upgrade to Kaggle and Colab since it uses an actual (not virtual) machine.

## Lesson 4 (NLP)
* In progress...
